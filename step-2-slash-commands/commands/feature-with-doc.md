description: Develop a new feature and automatically create documentation for it
argument-hint: <feature description>
---

Use the feature-with-doc-agent to implement this feature AND document it: $ARGUMENTS

The agent will:
1. Implement the feature with production-ready code
2. Create two brief documentation files (150-250 words total):
   - [FEATURE]-OPERATIONS.md - How to use the feature
   - [FEATURE]-ARCHITECTURE.md - Design decisions

This prevents documentation debt by documenting as we build. Workshop-optimized for speed.
