Use the initial-doc-agent to create quick, concise documentation for this project.

The agent will analyze the codebase and generate two brief documentation files:
1. HANDS-ON-GUIDE.md - Operational instructions (150-250 words)
2. ARCHITECTURE.md - Design decisions and overview (150-250 words)

This is optimized for workshop speed - essential information only.
